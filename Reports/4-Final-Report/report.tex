\section{Proposed Model ($>$1 page)}
This is not a copy and page from R2, it should be updated to reflect the final proposed model. Explain if there are multiple versions (e.g. your model has possible extensions, different amounts of exemplars, etc).  Please also include an easy to read model diagram here.

\section{Results (1 page)}
Replace columns with the correct metrics for your task (extrinsic). Include multiple versions of your final model.  You do not need to run on the test set but are encouraged to try if you have nice results on Dev.

\clearpage
\section{Analysis (2 pages)}
This section should include plots.  For example, how key metrics vary with a specific hyperparameter, task complexity, etc.

\subsection{Intrinsic Metrics}
These are not the task itself (they might overlap with auxiliary losses) but are skills the model should have.

\subsection{Qualitative Analysis and Examples (full page table)}
A full page table that includes: Example input, comparison of model outputs, theory about reason for failure. Every model presented should have at least one failure condition

\clearpage
\section{Future work and Limitations (0.5-1 page)}
Please thorough discuss the limitations of the proposed model.  Where are all the places it does not work, phenomena it does not capture, places that ideally it can be improved.
